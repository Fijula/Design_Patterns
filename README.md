Components:

Expression: Interface defining the interpret() method to interpret a context string.
TerminalExpression: Concrete class representing a single symbol or literal in the language.
NonTerminalExpression (Optional): Concrete class representing an operation or rule that combines other expressions. Examples include AndExpression, OrExpression, etc. (shown in the provided code).

Workflow:

Define the Language Grammar: Create classes representing terminals (literals) and non-terminals (operators or rules) of the language you want to interpret.
Build Expressions: Construct expression trees by combining terminal and non-terminal objects.
Evaluation: The interpret() method is called on the root node (entire expression) to evaluate the context string based on the defined rules.
