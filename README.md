Is a Relationship to Has a Relationship

KEY COMPONENT :

Abstraction: An interface defining the operations that can be performed on a concept.
Refined Abstraction (Optional): Concrete classes that extend the abstraction and provide specific implementations.
Implementation (Implementor): An interface defining the operations that need to be implemented.
Concrete Implementation (Concrete Implementor): Provides concrete implementations of the operations defined in the Implementation.

Scalable Video Processing

The text uses a video processing scenario to illustrate the Bridge Pattern's benefits.
Here, a base Video class (abstraction) can have a reference to a VideoProcessor (implementation).
Concrete video providers like Youtube and Netflix (refined abstractions) can be created without worrying about specific processing details.
Similarly, different VideoProcessor implementations like 4KProcessor and HDProcessor (concrete implementors) can be added without affecting existing video providers.
