Components in the Provided Code:

TextFileOperation Interface: Defines the execute() method that performs the specific text file operation.
Concrete Text File Operations (OpenTextFileOperation, SaveTextFileOperation): Implement the interface and encapsulate the logic for opening or saving a text file.
TextFile Class: Represents the text file itself and provides methods for opening and saving.
TextFileOperationExecutor Class: Manages the execution of text file operations.
executeOperation(TextFileOperation textFileOperation): Takes a TextFileOperation object, adds it to a list (potentially for queuing or logging), and executes it by calling its execute() method.
Workflow:

Define the Interface: Create an interface that defines the common operation for the commands (e.g., TextFileOperation in this example).
Implement Concrete Commands: Create concrete classes that implement the interface and encapsulate the logic for specific operations (e.g., OpenTextFileOperation, SaveTextFileOperation).
Create Receiver (Optional): In some cases, the command object might interact with a separate receiver object that holds the actual functionality (e.g., the TextFile class in this example).
Invoker: The invoker object (e.g., TextFileOperationExecutor) is responsible for receiving the command object and invoking its execute() method. The invoker might also handle additional logic like queuing commands or logging.
Code Walkthrough:

The TextFileOperationExecutor manages the execution of text file operations.
Concrete command objects (OpenTextFileOperation, SaveTextFileOperation) are created, each encapsulating an operation.
The executeOperation method of the invoker takes a command object, adds it to a list (for demonstration purposes), and executes it.
