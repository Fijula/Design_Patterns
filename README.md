Components:

Subject (NewsAgency): The object that holds the data and has a list of registered observers. It provides methods to add/remove observers and notify them when its state changes.
Observer (NewsChannel): The object interested in the subject's state changes. It implements an update method to receive notifications.
Workflow (Based on the Provided Code):

Define the Interface: Create an interface (Channel) with an update(Object) method to define the notification behavior.
Implement Subject and Observer: Create concrete classes (NewsAgency and NewsChannel) that implement their respective roles:
Subject (NewsAgency) has methods to:
Add/remove observers (addObserver, removeObserver)
Set new data and notify observers (setNews)
Observer (NewsChannel) implements the update(Object) method to receive notifications and store the updated data.
Create and Connect Objects:
Instantiate a subject (NewsAgency) and an observer (NewsChannel).
Register the observer with the subject (observable.addObserver(observer)) to establish the dependency.
Subject Updates: The subject modifies its data (setNews("news")).
Notification: The subject iterates through its registered observers and calls their update methods with the new data (channel.update(this.news)).
Observer Update: The observer receives the data in the update method and stores it (setNews((String) news)) for its use.
