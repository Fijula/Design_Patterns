Components:

Component (Pizza interface): Defines the interface for objects that can have functionalities added to them.
Concrete Component (BasePizza class): Implements the base functionality of the object (e.g., "Base Pizza").
Decorator (PizzaDecorator abstract class): Defines an interface for adding functionalities to the component. It typically holds a reference to a component object.
Concrete Decorator (CheeseBurstDecorator, JalepanoDecorator classes): Implement specific functionalities that can be added to the component. They extend the Decorator and forward requests to the wrapped component while adding their own behavior.
Workflow:

Define the Component Interface: Create an interface that defines the basic operations the objects can perform (e.g., bake()).
Implement Concrete Components: Create concrete classes for the base functionality (e.g., BasePizza).
Create Decorators: Design abstract or concrete decorator classes that extend the Decorator interface and wrap a component object. They add their own behavior while calling the core functionality of the wrapped component (pizza.bake() in this example).
Build Decorated Objects: Combine concrete decorators and the base component to create customized objects dynamically. You can layer multiple decorators to achieve complex functionality.
Code Walkthrough:

The Pizza interface defines the bake() method that returns the description of the pizza.
BasePizza implements the base functionality.
PizzaDecorator is an abstract class that holds a reference to a Pizza object (this.pizza).
CheeseBurstDecorator and JalepanoDecorator extend PizzaDecorator and add their respective functionalities (addCheese() and addJalepano()). They call pizza.bake() to get the base pizza description and then combine it with their own additions.
The main method demonstrates creating a pizza with both cheese burst and jalapeno toppings by wrapping a BasePizza with CheeseBurstDecorator and then JalepanoDecorator. Finally, it calls the bake() method on the decorated pizza to get the final description.
