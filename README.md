Components in the Code:

Originator (Originator class): The object whose state needs to be saved and restored.
setState(String state): Sets the internal state of the object.
getState(): Returns the current internal state of the object.
saveStateToMemento(): Creates a Memento object encapsulating the current state.
getStateFromMemento(Memento memento): Restores the internal state of the object from a Memento object.
Memento (Memento class): A lightweight object that stores a snapshot of the Originator's state.
Memento(String state): Constructor to initialize the state.
getState(): Returns the stored state of the Originator.
Caretaker (CareTaker class): (Optional) Manages the Memento objects, acting as an intermediary between the Originator and the external world.
add(Memento state): Adds a Memento object to the internal list.
get(int index): Retrieves a Memento object from the list by its index.
Workflow:

Originator Encapsulates State: The Originator object holds its internal state and provides methods to modify it.
Creating Memento: When a state needs to be saved, the Originator creates a Memento object that encapsulates a copy of its current state.
Caretaker (Optional): If used, the Memento object can be given to a Caretaker object that manages a collection of Memento objects for the Originator.
Restoring State: When the state needs to be restored to a previous point, the Originator retrieves a Memento object (either directly or through the Caretaker) and uses it to restore its internal state.
Code Walkthrough:

The MementoApplication creates an Originator and a CareTaker object.
The Originator's state is set to various values (State #1, State #2, etc.).
The saveStateToMemento() method of the Originator creates a Memento for each state and adds it to the CareTaker (if used).
The Originator's state is modified further (State #3, State #4).
The current state is printed (State #4).
Memento objects are retrieved from the CareTaker and used to restore the Originator's state to previous versions (State #1, State #2).
