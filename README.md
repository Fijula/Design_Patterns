Components:

Abstract Handler (PaymentHandler in the provided code): Defines the interface for handling requests and setting the next handler in the chain.
Concrete Handler (BankPaymentHandler, CreditCardPaymentHandler, PayPalPaymentHandler): Implements specific handling logic for a request type and optionally passes the request to the next handler in the chain if it cannot handle it itself.
Workflow:

Create Handlers: Instantiate concrete handler objects (e.g., BankPaymentHandler, CreditCardPaymentHandler, PayPalPaymentHandler).
Chain the Handlers: Set the next handler for each handler in the desired order (e.g., bank.setNext(creditCard);).
Initiate Request: Send the request to the first handler in the chain (e.g., bank.handlePayment(amount)).
Handling: Each handler checks if it can handle the request based on its criteria.
If yes, it processes the request and exits the chain.
If no, it passes the request to the next handler in the chain using the next reference.
End of Chain: If the request reaches the end of the chain without being handled, it can be considered an error or handled in a default way.

Code Breakdown:

The abstract class PaymentHandler defines the setNext() method for chaining handlers and the abstract handlePayment(double amount) method for handling payment requests.
Concrete handlers (BankPaymentHandler, CreditCardPaymentHandler, PayPalPaymentHandler) implement specific logic to handle payments within their respective limits and pass the request on if needed.
The ChainOfResponsibilityApplication creates handlers, chains them together, and then sends payment requests of different amounts to demonstrate the processing flow.
