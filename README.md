Components in the Provided Code:

Abstract User Class (User): Defines the basic user structure with a name and reference to the ChatMediator.
send(String msg): Abstract method to send messages.
receive(String msg): Abstract method to receive messages.
Concrete User Class (UserImpl): Implements the user behavior.
send(String msg): Sends a message through the mediator and prints a message indicating the user sending it.
receive(String msg): Prints a message indicating the user receiving the message.
ChatMediator Interface: Defines the methods for managing communication between users.
sendMessage(String msg, User user): Method for a user to send a message through the mediator.
addUser(User user): Method for adding a user to the chat.
ChatMediatorImpl Class (Concrete Mediator): Implements the ChatMediator interface.
sendMessage(String msg, User user): Iterates through all users and sends the message to everyone except the user who sent it.
addUser(User user): Adds a user to the list of users in the chat.
Workflow:

Define the Mediator Interface: Create an interface that defines how objects interact with the mediator (e.g., ChatMediator in this example).
Implement Concrete Mediator: Create a concrete class that implements the mediator interface and manages communication between objects (e.g., ChatMediatorImpl).
Create Objects: Instantiate user objects (e.g., UserImpl) and the mediator object.
Connect Objects: Add user objects to the mediator using the mediator's addUser method (e.g., mediator.addUser(user1)).
Communication: When a user wants to send a message, they call their send(String msg) method, which forwards the message to the mediator.
The mediator then iterates through all users and calls their receive(String msg) method, effectively broadcasting the message to everyone except the sender (achieved in sendMessage of ChatMediatorImpl).
