1)Define Straergy Interface:
 For that particular stratergy differnt stratergies implemnting
2)Implement Concrete Strategies:
Evry stratergy wil have method to perform the interface, every concrete classes need to implemnt 
 3)Implemnt context class(like client)- mediating the interaction between the different strategies and ultimately determining the behavior of the system- holding the refernce , setting stratergy,
 executing strtergy
 4)Client Code Interaction:

Client code interacts with the Context object.
